# Memory requirements 
Rough Estimates for Memory Requirements (per model, for a batch size of 1, on a CPU):

Model Type	Model Size	Estimated RAM Requirements
Small NLP Models	(e.g., DistilBERT)	2-4 GB
Medium NLP Models	(e.g., BERT-base)	8-12 GB
Large NLP Models	(e.g., BERT-large)	16-24 GB
Vision Models (Small)	(e.g., ViT-Base/32)	8-12 GB
Vision Models (Large)	(e.g., CLIP-ViT-L/14)	24-32 GB or more

Minimum Recommended System RAM: 16 GB (assuming you'll work with medium-sized models)
Preferred System RAM for Flexibility: 32 GB or more (to handle larger models or bigger batches)
